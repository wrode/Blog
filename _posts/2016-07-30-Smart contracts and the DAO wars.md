title: Smart contracts and the DAO wars?

1.
Spending time defining the meaning of words is boring, but smart contracts are one of those terms that can mean vastly different things to different people -- so we are forced to take a step back and agree about what a smart contract is.

Not that all this Blockchain crap isn't complicated enough already. In addition we have to discuss linguistics.

I am actually going against the Wikipedia definition of a smart contract, I am even going against the person who coined the term smart contract. This is because the way that smart contract is used today in the Blockchain communities is different than these definitions. But just to confuse you, I have decided to include the original definition of a smart contract:

Smart contract code + blockchain = smart contract

- There is the blockchain.
- Then there is the code that you publish on the blockchain.

How the code is interpreted by the Blockchain

    Do A *Machine does B :(

A smart contract is a contract that is able to execute itself.

So is a vending machine a smart contract?




    A smart contract is a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract.
*-Nick Szabo*

In the context of blockchain technology a smart contract is some computer code distributed on the blockchain.

Many blockchains have been set up in a way to perform clearly defined calculations between different states. One such blockchain is Bitcoin*, the state of the Bitcoin Blockchain is an agreement about how many Bitcoins each address owns. The predefined calculations describe how to send Bitcoins from one address to another.

Some Blockchains allow you to post some code on the blockchain that describes your own calculation between states. Anyone who wants to can interact with this code.


I.e. you cannot make a calculation that says, all the moneys belong to me - but you can create an "if this,  then that programs.

Computation


*Scripting is possible on the Blockchain.


Smart contract code is computer logic, so it is extremely flexible:


Others



Now that we agree about the meaning of smart contracts I would like to say that it is a highly inappropriate word for what we are describing - and we should be using something completely different. For the following reasons:
- It's just some code.
- The **smart** part implies that it is an entity which is intelligent.
- The **contract** part implies that it is an agreement and is legally binding.




Vendor machine example as a primitive ancestor to the smart contract.

Originally, smart contracts did not have to be part of a blockchain. The smart contract

This is not how smart contracts are being used today. Today there is a difference between the "smart contract" and the Blockchain.

The actual code that is being executed

To some extent smart contracts in the Blockchain world do live up to their original definition. But on the other hand they do not, as there has not been contract part has been missing.

I like personally to split between the blockchain and the smart contractl

Smart contracts are neither "contracts" nor smart.


Notes
- Smart contracts
    + Two elements of trust.
        *You need to trust the smart contract.
        *You need to trust the blockchain
    + "Smart contracts do not make people less stupid."
        
--- Now remember that for now, this is just code running in a machine - with very little promise to do anything in the outside world. What it can control is the token of the Blockchain, called ether. Which does have real world value. People are constantly trading it on the stock exchange.

--Why did Ethers price explode? Which problem did the DAO solve. The problem that people have ether worth a lot of money, and no great way to spend it.
-- Wanted to create a way for people to pool their money, and invest in new projects.
