Smart contracts are an important part of the enthusiasm surrounding blockchain technology. In this post, I try to explain exactly what a smart contract is.
<!--more-->

First, let's quickly do a recap of the magic analogy in the previous post to explain a blockchain (the original blog post can be found [here](http://allisabstract.com/2016/08/06/Blockchain.html)). For those of you who have not read the previous post, I explain what a blockchain is without using IT jargon by pretending it's based on magic and not technology. <!-- which is of course a complete and utter lie, magic does not exist, and neither does your god.--> A public blockchain can be imagined in the following way:

- An identical agreement is written on a set of enchanted documents.
- Anyone can take part in maintaining this agreement by owning one of these documents.
- Magic rules describe the changes you are allowed to make to a document.<!--the agreement-->
- Any valid change to one document is automatically made to all the other documents.<!--agreement on one document-->

These properties result in each participant owning an identical copy of the same agreement, even though the agreement undergoes continuous change. The illustration below shows how a change to one document is subsequently updated in the other documents:

The magic analogy above describes **one** set of enchanted documents (blockchain) that follow **one** set of magic rules. Different sets of enchanted documents have different magic rules that control the changes that are allowed to be made to them. The original set of enchanted documents is called Bitcoin, the magic rules for this set of documents are: <!--(super oversimplified, please do not kill me Bitcoiners)-->

1. Each enchanted document contains a list of all accounts and balances.
2. People own accounts, and can send their own bitcoins to other accounts.

In essence, these rules create a digital cash<!--should i write more here, if yes, I should write about Bitcoin being the currency - and all it really is is just a number next to your account on the global digital ledger-->. Below is an illustration of one of these enchanted documents. The number next to each account denotes the amount of bitcoins in that account.

<!--Remove the bitcoin logo from the bottom of the illustration -->
<!--Need to explain that the bitcoins are just the balances on the enchanted documents -->

Another set of documents is called Ethereum. The enchanted documents that make up Ethereum follow very similar rules to Bitcoin:

1. Each enchanted document contains a list of all accounts and balances.
2. Owners of accounts can send transactions to other accounts.

Those of you with an eye for details might have noticed slight differences in wording between the second rule of Ethereum and the second rule of Bitcoin. This difference in wording incorporates how the two sets of documents work differently. 

One of these differences is the fact that not all accounts on the Ethereum enchanted document is owned by people. Instead, the actions of these accounts are controlled by a set of instructions residing on the account.<!--The second difference is that in addition to sending the local currency between accounts, it is also possible to send information.## --> Below is an illustration of one of the enchanted documents on the Ethereum blockchain with some of the accounts controlled by instructions and not people:

![ethereum]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/ethereum.png)

When a set of instructions reside on one of these accounts it is called a **smart contract**. The set of instructions is just computer code, essentially - just logic. If "poked" by a transaction from another account, the smart contract can:

- Compute
- Store information
- Send transactions to other accounts

As mentioned, the account with the code is not controlled by anyone. It is completely autonomous. The original code is written by a person, but once the smart contract code has been uploaded on the blockchain, only the logic in the account dictates the actions of the account.

<!-- Write about smart contracts are a combination of the actual smart contract code and the blockchain-->

A small digression: From the cradle of civilization when money was first invented, people have been able to own money. Eventually, organized groups of people made up legal fictions, which were soon able to own money. Now, for the first time in history, a machine can own it's own money (through smart contracts). The consequences of this is hard to know, but we have interesting times ahead.

### Code is law

Many people are critical of the name "smart contract", as it is not a real contract - it is not something that needs to be complied with or upheld. Instead, it is a contract in the sense that it executes a set of conditions. If we compare the smart contract with a normal contract, some obvious differences are apparent:

![NormalvsSmart]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/NormalvsSmart.png){:style="width:120%; margin: 0 -10%"}

#### Legally binding

First of all, a normal contract has legal consequences in the 'real world'. If the counterparty of a contract does not uphold their part of the agreement, the legal system can be used to hold them accountable.

On the contrary, a smart contract does not have to be upheld by anyone, it's a set of instructions that self-executes. It's important to note however, that the smart contact does not have much precendence in the 'real world'. It is only able to send transactions to other accounts on the blockchain, yet these transactions can be balances with real world value.  Any other precedence must be aquired by creating a "legal wrapper" around the state of the blockchain.

#### Trust

When entering into a normal contract, several factors play an important role. The most obvious part is an understanding of the actual contract. The contract lays out the terms and conditions of an agreement in laywer language - which is what you are commiting to. Therefore, it is important to understand this laywerish language and how this is interpreted by the legal system. This is why you always carefully read the terms and conditions of your itunes agreement. *You* would never sign an agreement that commits you to providing your firstborn as payment for using their service, as 98% of people apparently [would](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2757465).

<!--Illustration paying with firstborn-->

Secondly, the terms and conditions that are laid out in a contract are constrained by a large body of existing law. This means that you can't be sure how the contract will play out by just looking at the writing in the agreement. There are laws that prohibit you from paying with your firstborn.

These contextual laws often work as a safeguard, at times making contracts work as *intended* instead of as *written*. Journalist Matt Levine has a great [article](http://dealbreaker.com/2013/07/electricity-market-rules-were-not-a-worthy-opponent-for-jpmorgans-brainpower/) about JPMorgan recieving a hetfy fine, even after following the conditions set forth in a contract. The contract regulated the electricity market, and JPMorgan found a way to game the contract. JPMorgan did not break the rules set forth in the contract, they followed them carefully, but they did break the intent of the contract and where caught in the net of market manipulation laws.

Even if you enslave your firstborn to try and uphold your part of a contract (which was [not unheard of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexum) in the early roman republic), there is still a risk that this is not enough. You could sell all your belongings and sell your family into debt bondage, but it might still not cover your obligations in the agreement. The risk of entering into a contract with someone who is not able to fullfill their part of the agreement is called counterparty risk, and must also be taken into account when entering a contract.

Last of all, even if you understand the contract and the legal context you still need to trust in the rule of law. Sometimes, de jure â‰  de facto. That's why you might be hesitant to go into an agreement with the son of the president in Corruptland. The contract is not worth the paper it's written on.<!--That's also why investors do not want to invest in Corruptland. Rule of law ensures that the investors are treated fairly. if you invest and get screwed over by the son of the president. -->
<!-- visual explanaition of the elements involved in trusting a normal contract-->

Like with normal contracts, several factors are important when considering smart contracts.

With smart contracts, what is written in the contract is important to understand. But the contract is written in computer code, so it is important that you understand the computer code and how this will be interpreted by a machine. Below is an example of what smart contract code actually look like:

```javascript
function payOut(address _recipient, uint _amount) returns (bool) {
  if (msg.sender != owner || msg.value > 0 || (payOwnerOnly && _recipient != owner))
      throw;
  if (_recipient.call.value(_amount)()) {
      PayOut(_recipient, _amount);
      return true;
  } else {
    return false;
    }
}
```

Once you understand. The computer code will act just as programmed. But there is one more element of trust, and that is the whole blockchain netwerk
- the Blockchain network as a whole

There is no legal wrapper here to make the contract code work as intended.

If there is breach of contract or disagreement, contract law will handle it. By definition there is no right or wrong - unless the whole network believes it is right or wrong.

No breach of agreement can exist. A smart contract will act exactly as programmed (note that this might be different from intended).

Taking people to court to uphold agreement is a very slow, expensive and inefficient - especially for smaller sums.

### Examples of smart contracts

- Give examples of what a smart contract can look like.
    + Talk about the fact that all contracts
- Need to talk about the fact that one smart contract can represent one application - therefore, you do not need a whole new blockcahin for every new idea. Many blockchains are sets of rules that define one specific application. 
- Talk about the fact that even though no person owns it, since it is defined by code it is possible to specify that one account has certain privileges that no one else has, thus rendering it in control by someone else.
- Include the diagram of the abstraction layers of different blockchains. Synereo, etc..

- Compliment smart contract
- TOKENS to represent anything
- Financial instruments
    + Stocks
    + Bonds
    + Options
- Decentralized applications (Dapps)
    + Decentralized stock exchange
    + Decentralized prediction markets
- MtoM
- DAOâ€™s
- Example of tokens created on the ethereum blockchain

### How to think about smart contracts and blockchains

- The ethereum blockchain is in one sense an abstraction layer below other blockchains (which is why it is ofter refered to as blockchain technology 2.0) such as:
    + Bitcoin
    + Steemit (is steemit just a DAO, or can smart contracts also be developed on its platform)
    + Namecoin etc.

Earlier, if you wanted to create a new application, you would need to create a whole new blockchain (with all the infrastructure). Now that is no longer the case.


Ethereum is not the only Blockchain which enables the use of smart contracts, but it is the biggest public blockchain which is built around this concept. Therefore, this blogpost will focus on the Ethereum blockchain.
