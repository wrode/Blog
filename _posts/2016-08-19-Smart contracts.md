Smart contracts 

First, let's quickly do a recapp of what a blockchain is (the original blog post can be found [here](http://allisabstract.com/2016/08/06/Blockchain.html)). We'll first pretend that blockchain technology is based on magic and not technology.

1. There exists a set of enchanted documents which are all the same
2. Anyone who wants can own one of these documents
3. There are some magic rules about which changes are allowed to make to the documents.
4. Any valid change to one document is automatically made to all the other documents.

There.

Different sets of enchanted documents can have different rules. The original set of enchanted documents (blockchain) is called Bitcoin. The Bitcoin magic rules are as follows (super oversimplified, please do not kill me Bitcoiners):

- Each enchanted document contains a list of all accounts and balances.
- People own accounts, and send their own bitcoins to other peoples accounts.

Another set of documents is called Ethereum. Ethereum has very similar rules to Bitcoin.
