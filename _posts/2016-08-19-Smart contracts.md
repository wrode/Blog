Smart contracts

<!--more-->

First, let's quickly do a recapp of our magic analogy to explain a blockchain (the original blog post can be found [here](http://allisabstract.com/2016/08/06/Blockchain.html)). For those of you who have not read the previous post, I basically try to explain blockchain through magic instead of technology:

1. There exists a set of enchanted documents which are all the same.
2. Anyone who wants can own one of these documents.
3. There are some magic rules about which changes you are allowed to make to the documents.
4. Any valid change to one document is automatically made to all the other documents.

There.

Different sets of enchanted documents can have different rules. The original set of enchanted documents (blockchain) is called Bitcoin. The Bitcoin magic rules are as follows (super oversimplified, please do not kill me Bitcoiners):

- Each enchanted document contains a list of all accounts and balances.
- People own accounts, and can send their own bitcoins to other peoples accounts.

<!-- Bitcoin illustration goes here-->

<!--need to explain-->

Another set of documents is called Ethereum. The enchanted documents that make up the Ethereum blockchain follow very similar rules to the Bitcoin blockchain:

- Each enchanted document contains a list of all accounts and balances.
- Owners of accounts can send ether to other accounts.

There are some differences however:

- Not all accounts are owned by people. Some special accounts have no owners.
- These special accounts have a set of instructions which control the actions of the account.


These are called a smart contract

<!-- Write about that smart contracts are a combination of the actual smart contract code-->

The as this set of instructions every time it's poked
