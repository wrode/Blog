Smart contracts 

First, let's quickly do a recapp of what a blockchain is (the original blog post can be found [here](http://allisabstract.com/2016/08/06/Blockchain.html)). We'll pretend that blockchain technology is based on magic and not technology. There are a set of rules

- There exists a set of enchanted documents which are all the same
- Anyone who wants can own one of these documents
- There are some magic rules about which changes are allowed to make to the documents.
- Any valid change to one document is automatically made to all the other documents.
