Why is blockchain technology revolutionary?
I should read Chris Skinners book before I post this.

Human civilization and agreement. Agreement is important for the human story.

Public blockchains vs private blockchain.

private blockchains
- Not as disruptive
- Like the media companies creating intranets to share information between them
- Or like them setting up an internet in which they were the only ones who could create internet pages.
- Morelike workflow tools.
- Do solve a problem that each actor might not have been willing to 
- Might make it harder for outsiders to compete

A tale of two blockchains.
Bitcoin vs Ethereum.

- introduce the two blockchains
- There are many others, like steem, but it may be not as relevant as the other blockchains.

How are blockchains similar to the internet?
- whats nice about ethereum is that it is the abstraction layer below bitcoin, steemit and namecoin. Which means that it can create all those things.
