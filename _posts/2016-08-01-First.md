I have started blogging. <!--more--> I'll be mostly writing about blockchainz and data visualization, but might create a brain dump of random thoughts every once in a while.

Huge disclaimer: The style of blogging I intend to do is a complete rip off of the blog [Wait, but why](http://waitbutwhy.com/). It's the best thing I have ever read, so if you havenâ€™t read **all** the posts on that blog yet - I would definitively do that first.

A very short introduction:
- My name is William
- I live in Oslo, Norway
- I work as a consultant
