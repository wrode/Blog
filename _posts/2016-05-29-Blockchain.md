title: What is a Blockchain?
draft: true

<!--more-->

    A Blockchain is a decentralized database that carries out transactions based on a predefined protocol.

There, know you know that.

The problem is, if you are like most people, this sentence wasn´t very helpful. In some circles, Blockchain is so hot right now, it´s the talk of the town. But even though there is a lot of discussion about Blockchain technology, not that many people actually understand what this thing is. Or more importantly - what it can become.

Most explanations of blockchain are full of IT jargon. So unless you know IT, the explanations don´t really help. In this post I try to explain blockchain without the IT part, and why it is such a big deal.

### Agreement

Agreement is nice. Whether its agreeing about the best football team, what cheese tastes good or which political candidate will make a country great again. If you take a step back and look, different types of agreements exist everywhere. It´s not only the explicit agreements you might have in a conversation. The very fact and are able to communicate abstract ideas with  another person is based on an agreement about the meaning of the words being spoken.

    more than one agreement here

Different types of agreement have varying degrees of societal consequence. Some subjects are unimportant to reach an agreement about. It is not very important that you agree with your friend about the best tasting cheese. In this case, you can agree to disagree, and go off eating the cheese that you prefer. Other things are a little more important, say that you are a couple that can only afford to buy one type of cheese. If you dont agree about what cheese to buy, hard feelings and arguments may pursue. Other things have a larger impact on society, such as agreeing about language and the meaning of words.

![Consequences for society]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/ConsequencesForSociety.jpg)

For societies to function, there needs to be a common agreement about some of the more important subjects. An obvious place to start, is agreeing about the rules of the society.

- The fact that people in the society *can* own things is one such rule. This may seem like a no brainer, but its not actually a given, take some of the hippy [communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune) as an example.
- Another rule is allowing individuals to enter into binding agreements with eachother. This rule would define what members of the society are able to make agreements about, and what process to follow if the agreement was not being upheld. Essentially, an agreement about how to handle agreements.

### Ownership

Once you have established the agreement that individuals can own things, the next step is to make sure there is agreement about who owns what. For some things, such as the personal property which I wear - it´s pretty clear. If I make some sandals out of hemp, they are either on my feet or in my apartment.# But what about the actual apartment itself? What is stopping someone from sneaking in to my apartment and claiming it for themselves whilst I stroll about town with in my hemp sandals?

Everyone in todays expansive societies cannot possibly be expected to keep an updated list of who owns which real estate. And you cannot trust individuals to report this themselves, because there is an incentive problem. Why would society trust that the apartment is mine when the other guy claiming that the apartment is his is just as credible. In fact, he´s more credible, because he is wearing a suit and I am wearing hemp sandals.

    picture of two people claiming that they own an apartment. Picture of an apartment door. Door number can be reference to planet money podcast.

There needs to be some sort of way that society agrees upon who owns what. One single source of the "truth". This is usually solved by one central authority documenting the state of things.

- Some form of government will document who owns which real estate. 
- A bank will dokument the balance of account holders.
- A central bank will document the balance of the banks.

    picture of a guy claiming that he is really really rich.
    "i am really really rich"
    "But jon, you have $5 in your bank account"
    - people, they cant be trusted

-documenting isnt really enough, enforcing is also important.


### Agreeing about agreements

In societies today you have a central authority for documenting and enforcing the agreement about agreements. This is the legislative branch of the government. If there is a dispute about a particular signed agreement, then you can take this agreement to the authority, who in turn chooses what to do about the dispute (AKA going to court).

### Blockchain

For both **ownership** and **agreement about agreements** the solution is having one source of the truth. One agreed upon state. The solution has usually always been to have one central authority who is in charge of this state.


Blockchain is essentially just a new way of documenting the state. It´s a way to make a group agree about how .



- Contracts are the things that need to be explicitly defined. When there needs to be agreement.
- Political views, but there is agreement about who can govern even if there is no agreement about who should govern.
- de facto vs de jura - queen in england owning all the land
- Normally not something that you think about in everyday life. Because, it is obvious. Someone cannot just take over your home after you were away for the weekend.
- contracts are a strange case, because no central authoroty actually keeps this state. But both parties have signed versions of the contract which is presented to a central authority in the case a dispute has to be solved.

- Its worth noting that not everyone might agree with the rules of the society. In fact, they probably dont, but they know the consequences if they do not agree about something.

Another form agreement is social norms, of how you should and should not behave in certain settings.

There are other types of implicit agreements, such as eyeballing the girlfriend of the bulky guy with the tribal tatoo.

- if today you someone had sneaked in your apartment and claimed it fo rthemselves, the first people that the police would check with is probably the neighbours. They likely do have an up to date view about who owns what. And the police trust them to be honest.
    + But you cannot be sure that they have an up to date view of the world. What if the unknown stranger had just paid a large sum of money for the apartment but the old owner still claimed ownership.
- Agreement is very important in my project. The governance structure is extremely important. It could be made using a smart contract.
- The good thing about smart contract is that everything needs to be so explicitly defined. This means that there is less room missunderstanding.
- To understand how private blockchains, think about a small group of people agreeing about the state of something rather than many people agreeing about something.
