    A Blockchain is a decentralized state, updated through transactions based on a predefined protocol.

There, now you know that. The problem is, if you are like most people this sentence wasn´t very helpful. 

In some circles, Blockchain is so hot right now, it´s the talk of the town. But even though there is a lot of discussion about Blockchain technology, few people actually understand what this thing is. Or more importantly - what it can become.

Most explanations of blockchain are full of IT jargon. So unless you know IT, the explanations don´t really help. In this post I try to explain blockchain without the IT part, and why it is such a big deal. First however, I will go on what seems like a tangent - bear with me.

### Agreement

Agreement is nice. Whether its agreeing about the best football team, what cheese tastes good or which political candidate will make a country great again. If you take a step back and look, different types of agreements exist everywhere. It´s not only the explicit agreements you might have in a conversation<!--the subject of the conversation-->. The very fact that you are able to communicate abstract ideas with  another person is based on an agreement about the meaning of the words being spoken.

*More than one agreement here*

Different types of agreement have varying degrees of societal consequence. Some subjects are unimportant to reach an agreement about. As an example, it is not very important that you agree with your friend about the best tasting cheese. In this case, you can agree to disagree, and go off eating the cheese that you prefer. Other things are a little more important, say that you are a couple that can only afford to buy one type of cheese. If you don´t agree about what cheese to buy, hard feelings and arguments may pursue. But for society as a whole, agreement here is still not very important. On the other end of the scale there are things which are really important for a society as a whole to agree about in order to function. <!--Dont like the last sentence here-->One such thing is agreeing about language and the meaning of words.

![Consequences for society]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/ConsequencesForSociety.jpg)

For societies to function, there needs to be a common agreement about some of the more important subjects. An obvious place to start is agreeing about the rules of the society. also known as the laws.


#### Agreeing about agreements

One of these laws may be to allow people to enter into bindings agreements with one another. The agreement defines what members of the society *can* make agreements about, and what process to follow if an agreement is not being upheld. Essentially, it is an agreement about how to handle agreements.

<!--Sketch of person making an agreement to sell his children to slavery, and then the law saying "no"-->

This agreement exists in most modern societies, but it is not without restrictions. People can not enter into *any* binding agreement they wish, there are restrictions. Minimum wage is an example of one of these restrictions - you are not allowed to agree to work for an hourly wage which is less than the agreed upon minimum.

The agreement about agreements is know as contract law. Modern societies have a central authority for documenting, updating and enforcing the contract law. This is part of the legislative branch of the government. If there is a dispute about an agreement, then you can take this agreement to the government, who in turn chooses what to do about the dispute (this is also known as going to court).

#### Ownership

Another rule is whether people in the society *can* own things at all. This may seem like a no brainer, but its not actually a given, take some of the hippy [communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune) as an example.

Once you have established the agreement that individuals can own things, the next step is to make sure there is agreement about who owns what. For some things, such as the personal property which I wear - it´s pretty clear. If I make some sandals out of hemp, they are either on my feet or in my apartment. It is also not the end of the world if I happened to lose them. Likewise, it sucks to lose other pieces of clothing, my wallet, my playstation controller etc. But again, it´s not the end of the world, life goes on. 

Then there are the big things. Things that *really* do impact you if you lose them. An example of a big thing is the apartment that you own. Losing that apartment would be life changing. If it was possible to steal an apartment in the same way that you could steal a purse, then that is what thiefs would be doing because that is were the big bucks would be. People would be spending their time protecting their apartment, and society as a whole would not function well. Therefore, it is important that society agrees about who owns the big things.

So what is stopping another person from sneaking in to my apartment and claiming it for himself, while I am strolling about town in my new hemp sandals? 

The problem is that todays societies are so huge that people can´t be expected to keep track of who owns which apartment. You cannot trust individuals to report this themselves, because there is an incentive problem. 

Why would society trust that the apartment is mine when the con artist claiming that the apartment is his is just as credible. In fact, he´s more credible, because he is wearing a suit and I am wearing hemp sandals.

![Who owns the apartment]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/WhosApartment.jpg)

Just like with the agreement about agreements, agreement about ownership is solved in our societies by relying on a single source of "truth" - centrally administrated by a trusted authority.

In the case of apartments, the government owns a central registry of who owns what land. But there are also many other registries which keep track of who owns what (among other things):

<!--Could talk about the different types of registers here. How ancients used stone tablets or Quipus as their registreries-->

- Governments keep track of who owns what veichle registration plates.
- Kennel clubs keep track of who owns what dog through a breed registry.
- The nonprofit organization ICANN keeps track of who owns what internet domain names. 
- A bank keeps an up to date ledger with the balance of account holders.

<!--should write a sentence here, summarizing the above paragraph-->

### Blockchain

Ok, but what does blockchain technology have to do with agreements?

Blockchain technology is essentially just a new way to reach agreement about the state of something. What's new is that unlike the traditional methods that we mentioned above, the agreement is not administrated (controlled) by a central authority.

<!--Should i emphasize the importance of the word state?-->

Instead of the central authority owning a single document that captures the agreed upon state, everyone who wants to document the agreed upon state is allowed to do so <!--for public blockchains-->. Let us call the people who wants to take part in documenting the state **Peeps**. 

<!--
    Should have an image of a large amount of people here, with some of them with their hands up in the air. An an arrow signaling that these are the peeps
-->

Ofcourse, the agreed upon state *should* not vary between the Peeps -> then there would not be agreement. In order to ensure that all the Peeps have the same agreement documented, they would need to meet, document the state, and then sign eachothers document. This might be fine if the agreement in question did not change, or if only changed once every 10 years. The problem arises when you have an agreement which changes often. If all the Peeps needed to meet, update and sign a new version of the document every time someone makes a bank transaction, this system would be extremely inefficient.

<!--
    The society as a whole would need to agree that most of the peeps were honest

    This might lead just a few people willing to be PEEPS. This would then mean that the whole thing was centralized.
-->

The ability for many Peeps to keep an up-to-date documentation of the agreed upon state is what the Blockchain technology enables. Once you start asking *how* the Blockchain technology does this you start venturing down the rabbit hole and things can get IT jargony very quickly. Fortunately, we can pretend that Blockchains are based on **magic** instead of fancy **technology**.

<!-- Am I cheating by using magic to get around the promise of not using IT jargon? -->

![You´re a wizard]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/wizardHarry.png)

Imagine if all the Peeps have a copy of an enchanted document with the agreed upon state. These enchanted documents have the following magic properties:

1. The document has a set of rules which need to be followed in order to make an update to the agreed upon state.
2. If an update is made to one of the enchanted documents in accordance to the rules, this update will magically be applied to all the other enchanted documents.

These magic properties ensure that all the Peeps have an identical and up-to-date copy of the agreement. There is no central authority which owns the definitive agreed upon state, all the Peeps have their own copy. This is why Blockchains are refered to as decentralized, there is no central controller of the truth.

<!--illustration showing documents being updated based on one enchanted document being updated

Should mention that each seperate blockchain needs a way to incentivise the peers to take part in the network. !!Value token.
-->

The rules of the enchanted documents can vary between sets of enchanted documents.

- One set could be controlled by rules which specify ownership.
- Another set could be controlled by rules about how to handle agreements written on the enchanted document.

Below we present an example of the first use of enchanted documents.

#### Sato the Wizard

A wizard (lets call him Sato) wants to make a new currency, but he does not want to deal with the hassle of administration. Therefore, he decides to create a set of enchanted documents. He hands out a copy of the enchanted documents to any Peep that wants to own one. The document contain a list of people and their balance of the new currency. Sato enchants the document with the following rule:

    You can send anyone else your own money. By reducing the balance next to your name and increasing the balance next to the recipient by a corresponding amount.

This rule implicitly states that you cannot increase your own balance, it can only be increased by someone else sending you money. If evil Peep A tries to change the document by increasing his own balance, or reducing the balance of anyone else, the enchantment ensures that the other enchanted documents ignore his updates.

Blockchains are ofcourse not based on magic, but on the conceptual level, this simplification is good enough. Blockchains, like the example sets of enchanted documents, have different rules about how to update the agreed upon state.

<!-- could mention that the agreed upon state is done at a block at a time-->



<!--Should mention that bitcoin is similar to the above example, it only has value. People do not really need to believe that bitcoin has value, as long as someone believes that other people believe that bitcoin has value thats enough.
"just like indian/chineese traders originally didnt see the value of gold, they saw that europeans saw that this had value."

What do you need to trust? The network, or for ethereum the network and the smart contracts.

Important to note that the document is just an agreement on paper. Consequences in the real world need to be enforced. On chain consequences are different.
-->



<!--
This also means that there is no central authority who can independently change the rules of the blockchain. The rules are already set in the blockchain, and a government, or a bank must follow these rules like everyone else.

Talk about the weak link between the blockchain and the real world. For example, that scarcity of a certain type of token. And this only has value in the real world because people are willing to pay a price for it.

That’s what is meant by decentralized. Instead of one entity managing a central truth for everyone else, now many entities can own an up to date copy of the truth.

Its all about documenting the state of things. One truth which there is agreement about (at least on the societal level)

- Contracts are the things that need to be explicitly defined. When there needs to be agreement.
- Political views, but there is agreement about who can govern even if there is no agreement about who should govern.
- de facto vs de jura - queen in england owning all the land
- contracts are a strange case, because no central authoroty actually keeps this state. But both parties have signed versions of the contract which is presented to a central authority in the case a dispute has to be solved.

- Its worth noting that not everyone might agree with the rules of the society. In fact, they probably dont, but they know the consequences if they do not agree about something.
    + It does not matter . Its a fiction, a legal fiction

- if today you someone had sneaked in your apartment and claimed it fo rthemselves, the first people that the police would check with is probably the neighbours. They likely do have an up to date view about who owns what. And the police trust them to be honest.
    + But you cannot be sure that they have an up to date view of the world. What if the unknown stranger had just paid a large sum of money for the apartment but the old owner still claimed ownership.
- The good thing about smart contract is that everything needs to be so explicitly defined. This means that there is less room missunderstanding.
- Explain that there are private and public blockchains

-documenting isnt really enough, enforcing is also important.

There needs to be some sort of way that society agrees upon who owns what. One single source of the "truth". This is usually solved by one central authority documenting the state of things.
