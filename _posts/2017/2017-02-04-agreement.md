Agreement is nice. Whether its agreeing about the best football team, what cheese tastes good or which political candidate will make a country great again. If you take a step back and observe, you will find different types of agreements existing everywhere. It's not only the explicit agreements which are the subjects of conversations. The very fact that you are able to communicate abstract ideas with another person is based on an agreement about the meaning of the words being spoken.

...*more than one agreement here*

Different types of agreement have varying degrees of societal consequence. Some subjects are unimportant to reach an agreement about. As an example, it is not very important that you agree with your friend about the best tasting cheese. In this case, you can agree to disagree, and go off eating the cheese that you prefer. Other things are a little more important, say that you are a couple that can only afford to buy one type of cheese. If you don't agree about what cheese to buy, hard feelings and arguments may pursue. But for society as a whole, agreement here is still not very important. On the other end of the scale there are things that are really important for a society as a whole to agree about in order to function. <!--Dont like the last sentence here-->One such thing is agreeing about language and the meaning of words.

For societies to function, there needs to be a common agreement about some of the more important subjects. An obvious place to start is agreeing about the rules of the society, also known as the laws.

#### Agreeing about agreements

One of these laws may be to allow people to enter into bindings agreements with one another. The agreement defines what members of the society *can* make agreements about, and what process to follow if an agreement is not being upheld. Essentially, it is an agreement about how to handle agreements.

<!--Sketch of person making an agreement to sell his children to slavery, and then the law saying "no"-->

This agreement exists in most modern societies, but it is not without restrictions. People can not enter into *any* binding agreement they wish, there are restrictions. Minimum wage is an example of one of these restrictions - you are not allowed to agree to work for an hourly wage which is less than the agreed upon minimum.

The agreement about agreements is know as contract law. Modern societies have a central authority for documenting, updating and enforcing the contract law. If there is a dispute about an agreement, then you can take this agreement to the government, who in turn chooses what to do about the dispute (this is also known as going to court).

#### Ownership

Another subject that is important to reach agreement about is whether people in the society *can* own things at all. This may seem like a no brainer, but its not actually a given, take some of the hippy [communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune) as an example.

Once you have established the agreement that individuals can own things, the next step is to make sure there is agreement about who owns what. For some things, such as the personal property which I wear - it's pretty clear. If I make some sandals out of hemp, they are either on my feet or in my apartment. It is also not the end of the world if I happened to lose them. Likewise, it sucks to lose other pieces of clothing, my wallet, my PlayStation controller etc. but again, it's not the end of the world, life goes on.

Then there are the *big things*. Things that really do impact you if you lose them. An example of a big thing is the apartment that you own. Losing that apartment would be life changing. If it was possible to steal an apartment in the same way that you could steal a purse, then that is what thiefs would be doing because that is were the big bucks would be. People would be spending their time protecting their apartment, and society as a whole would not function well. Therefore, for the *big things*, it is important that society agrees about who owns what.

So what is stopping another person from sneaking in to my apartment and claiming it for himself, while I am strolling about town in my new hemp sandals?

<!--The problem is that todays societies are so huge that people can't be expected to keep track of who owns which apartment. You cannot trust individuals to report this themselves, because there is an incentive problem.-->

Why would society trust that the apartment is mine when the con artist claiming that the apartment is his is just as credible? In fact, he's more credible, because he is wearing a suit and I am wearing hemp sandals.

This problem is solved by the government owning a central registry of who owns what real estate. This is just one example, but ownership of *big things* is usually solved through central registries. Below are some examples of other registries which keep track of who owns what:

<!--Could talk about the different types of registers here. How ancients used stone tablets or Quipus as their registreries-->

- Governments keep track of vehicle ownership using a registry of registration plates.
- Kennel clubs keep track of who owns what dog through a breed registry.
- The nonprofit organization ICANN keeps track of who owns what internet domain names.
- A bank keeps an up to date ledger with the balance of account holders.

Just like with the agreement about agreements, agreement about ownership is solved in our societies by relying on a single source of "truth" - centrally administrated by a trusted authority.
