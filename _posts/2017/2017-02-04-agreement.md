*This post is the first post in a series on blockchain technology, have a look at the introduction to get an overview of the posts. The topic of agreement might seem like a digression in this series, but agreement is central to blockchain technology.*

Agreement is nice. Whether its agreeing about the best football team, what cheese tastes good or which political candidate will make a country great again. If you take a step back and observe, you will find different types of agreements existing everywhere. It's not only the explicit agreements which are the subjects of conversations. The very fact that you are able to communicate abstract ideas with another person is based on an agreement about the meaning of the words being spoken.

...*more than one agreement here*

Different types of agreement have varying degrees of societal consequence. Some subjects are unimportant to reach an agreement about. As an example, it is not very important that you agree with your friend about the best tasting cheese. In this case, you can agree to disagree, and go off eating the cheese that you prefer. Other things are a little more important, say that you are a couple that can only afford to buy one type of cheese. If you don't agree about what cheese to buy, hard feelings and arguments may pursue. But for society as a whole, agreement here is still not very important. On the other end of the scale there are things that are really important for a society as a whole to agree about in order to function. One such thing is agreeing about language and the meaning of words.

For societies to function, there needs to be a common agreement about some of the more important subjects. An obvious place to start is agreeing about the rules of the society, also known as the laws.

#### Agreeing about agreements

One of these laws may be to allow people to enter into bindings agreements with one another. The agreement defines what members of the society *can* make agreements about, and what process to follow if an agreement is not being upheld. Essentially, it is a societal agreement about how to handle agreements between participants in the society.

<!--Sketch of person making an agreement to sell his children to slavery, and then the law saying "no"-->

This agreement exists in most modern societies, but it is not without restrictions. People can not enter into *any* binding agreement they wish. Minimum wage is an example of one of these restrictions - you are not allowed to agree to work for an hourly wage which is less than the agreed upon minimum.

The agreement about agreements is known as contract law. Modern societies have a central authority for documenting, updating and enforcing the contract law. If there is a dispute about an agreement, then you can take this agreement to the government, who in turn chooses what to do about the dispute (this is also known as going to court).

#### Ownership

Another subject that is important to reach societal agreement about is whether people in the society *can* own things at all. This may seem like a no brainer, but its not actually a given, take some of the hippy [communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune) as an example.

Once you have established the agreement that individuals can own things, the next step is to make sure there is agreement about who owns what. For some things, such as the personal property which I wear - it's pretty clear. If I make some sandals out of hemp, they are either on my feet or in my apartment. It is also not the end of the world if I happened to lose them. Likewise, it sucks to lose other pieces of clothing, my wallet, my PlayStation controller etc. but again, it's not the end of the world, life goes on.

Then there are the *big things*. Things that really do impact you if you lose them. An example of a big thing is the apartment that you own. Losing that apartment would be life changing. If it was possible to steal an apartment in the same way that you could steal a purse, then that is what thiefs would be doing because that is were the big bucks would be. People would be spending their time protecting their apartment, and society as a whole would not function well. Therefore, for the *big things*, it is important that society agrees about who owns what.

So what is stopping another person from sneaking in to my apartment and claiming it for himself, while I am strolling about town in my new hemp sandals?

Why would society trust that the apartment is mine when the con artist claiming that the apartment is his is just as credible? In fact, he's more credible, because he is wearing a suit and I am wearing hemp sandals.

For a smaller tribe, the solution to this problem is very simple. Everyone knows everyone else, and there are not a lot of people and mud huts to keep track of. Everyone in the tribe can keep track of which mud hut belongs to everyone else. Essentially, most people in the tribe has the agreement about ownership memorised. If one family chooses to trade a mud hut with some cattle of another family, then this transaction is communicated to the rest of the tribe and the agreement about ownership is updated in the heads of the members of the tribe. If one family tries to claim a mud hut which is not theirs, then the rest of the tribe will know they are lying.

The problem is that we have limited memory, thinking and communication abilities. So for the mass societies that you and I live in, tracking ownership in this distributed human manner is not possible. In mass societies, this problem has been solved by the government owning a central registry of who owns what real estate. This registry is maintained, updated and enforced by the government.

<!--You cannot trust individuals to report this themselves, because there is an incentive problem.-->

Real estate is one just one example, but ownership of other *big things* is usually solved through central registries. Below are some other examples of registries which keep track of who owns what:

- Governments keep track of vehicle ownership using a registry of registration plates.
- Kennel clubs keep track of who owns what dog through a breed registry.
- The nonprofit organization ICANN keeps track of who owns what internet domain names.
- A bank keeps an up to date ledger with the balance of account holders.

#### Keeping track of the Inter-subjective

Modern societies are built on agreement about some topics which are *not* part of an objective reality. These common myths include nation states, ownership, money, laws, contracts, religions and human rights. None of these phenomena are part of the natural world, but some are still necessary for modern societies to function.

These sets of commonly shared, subjective beliefs have been named the inter-subjective. Since many individuals within a larger community believe in them, they appear to be objective phenomena from an individual's perspective. The agreement about these phenomena is what allows us to co-operate. I am willing to trade my hemp sandals for money, because I believe that someone else is willing to accept the same money when I am buying food. As historian Yuval Harari argues in the great book *Sapiens*, the only way that a larger number of strangers can co-operate is by successfully believing in a set of common myths. In essence, societal agreement about some subjective phenomena is what enables mass co-operation and allows modern complex societies to function.

Since the inter-subjective does not objectively exist, modern societies formalize these agreements by documenting them and claim them to be the truth. Trusted authorities are used for maintaining these single sources of "truth". This is true for agreements about agreements (contract law and contracts) and agreements about ownership.

Agreements have been maintained in this central manner because there has been no other way to do it. **Until now**. Blockchain technology enables agreements to be maintained by a group of participants, instead of one central trusted authority.
