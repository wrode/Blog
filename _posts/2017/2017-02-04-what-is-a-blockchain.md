>A Blockchain is a decentralized documented state, updated through transactions based on a predefined protocol.

There, now you know that. The problem is, if you are like most people this sentence wasn't very helpful.

In some circles, blockchain is so hot right now, it's the talk of the town. But even though there is a lot of discussion about blockchain technology, few people actually understand what this thing is. Or more importantly - what it can become.

Most explanations of blockchain are full of IT jargon. So unless you know IT, the explanations don't really help. In the posts below, I try to explain what blockchain technology is without going into the techy parts. The posts are written in chronological order, and should probably be read in that order in order to be understandable.

[Agreement][1]   | *Agreements are important part of how societies function*
[Blockchain][2]        | *At its core, blockchain technology is all about agreement*
[Smart contracts][3]  |  *Smart contracts*
The DAO wars       |  *A case study, that looks into one of the blockchain spaces most spectacular failures*
